## 🧮 Mathematical Foundations

## Complexity Calculation
```python
def calculate_complexity(self, frame):
    gray = cv.cvtColor(frame, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    return np.var(gray) # Variation method
```
Mathematical Basis: Uses variance (σ²) to measure how "busy" a scene is:

Low variance = Flat, uniform areas (simple effects)

High variance = Detailed, textured areas (complex effects)

Dynamic Thresholding
```python
self.threshold = np.median(self.complexities)
Statistical Method: Uses median of recent frame complexities to adapt to different lighting conditions without being affected by outliers.
```
